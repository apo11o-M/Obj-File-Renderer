# Obj File Renderer

**Insert a demo gif here**

## What is this?
Renders OBJ file formats to a 2D display using C++ and the Simple and Fast
Multimedia Library (SFML).

Currently I am still experimenting with the concept so it still has limited features.
In the future I will be constantly adding more stuff such as being able to move
the camera and improve the performance so it can draw out the model more quickly.


## How do I use it?


## Timeline:
4/2/2021
- Migrate the 3D model renderer from the previous repo "Simple3DModelRenderer"
to here using C++ and SFML library for faster speed
